DMM: Decision Making Manager

This program is designed to help the user prioritize their tasks and goals depending on their urgency and importance.

Personally, this is a tedious day-to-day task that I have failed to master myself, which has motivated me to go ahead and start this personal project

The project timeline looks like this:

Backend that organizes tasks and sorts them into urgency-importance order, created with Java
--> CRUD function through SQL
--> Implement frontend UI/UX through React, or in other langauges, so that the program can be used on a mobile device

Features:
Add, edit, delete, and save Task, set its urgency and importance
Sort current tasks according to urgency and importance
Draw a grid that visualizes where each tasks fits under the decision making matrix
Add time-sensitive tasks, where the importance and urgency changes over time
